## ✨ Features

-   **11 Fruit Classes**: Accurately classifies a wide variety of common fruits.
-   **High Accuracy**: Built on the MobileNetV2 architecture for efficient and precise predictions.
-   **Interactive Fun Facts**: Displays a random fun fact for each correctly identified fruit.
-   **Handles Unknown Images**: Implements a confidence threshold to gracefully handle images that are not fruits.
-   **Responsive UI**: Clean and simple user interface that works on desktop and mobile.
-   **RESTful API**: Backend powered by FastAPI, serving model predictions.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

-   **Model**: TensorFlow / Keras (MobileNetV2)
-   **Backend**: FastAPI, Uvicorn
-   **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
-   **Deployment**: Heroku, Git

## 🎯 Project Motivation

The primary goal is to develop an accurate and lightweight fruit classification system that can run efficiently. MobileNetV2 was specifically chosen as the backbone architecture because of its efficiency on resource-constrained devices, small size, and suitability for transfer learning. This has several practical applications in mobile apps, agricultural tech, and educational tools.

## 🚀 Local Development Setup

To run this web application on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd fruit-classification-app
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Run the FastAPI server:**
    ```bash
    uvicorn src.api:app --reload
    ```
4.  Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## 🧠 Model Training Details

The model was trained separately. The training repository contains scripts and data used to generate the final `model.h5` file.

-   **Dataset**: ~31,000 images across 11 fruit categories, sourced from Kaggle and free stock image websites.
-   **Training Strategy**: Transfer learning with a frozen MobileNetV2 base, a custom classification head, and data augmentation.

## 📈 Future Improvements

-   Implement model quantization for further size reduction.
-   Add real-time classification via webcam.
-   Expand the dataset to include more fruit varieties.
